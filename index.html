            <h3>Dissertation: Smart Plant Image Classification</h3>
            <p>An iOS application which uses a trained and tuned image classification model converted to CoreML to classify the images locally. </p>

            <h3>Basic Weather App</h3>
            <p>A very basic weather app which uses API calls to check for the weather with the user's iPhone location. I used this to learn and prepare for my dissertation as I knew I wanted to do something surrounding an iOS application.</p>

            <h3>REST API (FAST API)</h3>
            <p>This project involved developing REST API endpoints for a fictional business system, allowing efficient data retrieval, updates and deletions for HR, admin and sales operations. It also makes use of Swagger.  A handful endpoints were developed such as GET, POST, PUT and DELETE. The API is desgined to handle up to 50 employees records at a time, ensuring performance is optimised. Pagination or rate limiting can be added for larger datasets in the future. This was one of my assignments for my Cloud Computing module.</p>

            <h3>Custom Image Classification Model (Keras - TensorFlow) </h3>
            <p>For part of my dissertation, I trained a machine learning model for image classification. I used Keras (TensorFlow) and MobileNetV2 as a base which also used transfer learning from ImageNet. For training I used a customised version of the Oxford102Flowers dataset. I added more images to make the dataset more balanced and added more classes. It was then converted to the CoreML format for efficient use of the Neural Engine found on modern iOS devices.</p>
